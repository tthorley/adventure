h2. Adventure

I wanted to create a site that allowed a select group of authors write 
something like the choose-your-own-adventure books I enjoyed as a kid.

h3. Requirements

* Framework: sinatra
* Interface: haml
* ORM: datamapper
* Database: sqlite3

You'll need the following gems: sinatra, haml, dm-core, do_sqlite3

h3. Setup

Initially, you'll need to create the database file in the "data" directory:
@sqlite3 production.db < schema.sql@

If you want to run tests:
@sqlite3 test.db < schema.sql@

h3. Execution

1. @ruby adventure.rb@
2. open a browser to @localhost:4567@
